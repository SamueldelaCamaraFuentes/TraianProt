\title{Obtain Unique Proteins Between Conditions}
\usage{
obtain_unique_proteins(df, metadata, selected_conditions)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{A data frame containing expression data, with LOG2 intensity
columns and a 'Protein' column.}

\item{metadata}{A data frame with sample metadata. Must have 'group' and
'log2_col' columns.}

\item{selected_conditions}{A character vector of length 2 specifying the two
groups from the 'group' column to compare.}
}
\value{
A list containing two data frames:
1. \code{cond1_unicas}: A data frame of proteins unique to the first group.
2. \code{cond2_unicas}: A data frame of proteins unique to the second group.
}
\description{
Identifies proteins that are uniquely present in one of two
conditions, based on the presence of finite (e.g., LOG2 intensity) vs.
non-finite (e.g., Inf, NA) values.
}
\details{
This function is designed for label-free data where a protein's
absence is marked by a non-finite value (like Inf from a log-transformation
of 0). It identifies proteins present in at least half of the replicates of
one condition while being completely absent (non-finite) in the other.

\examples{
# Create synthetic data with infinite values (representing missing)
df_prot <- data.frame(
  Protein = paste0("Prot", 1:4),
  LOG2.C1 = c(10, 12, Inf, 9),
  LOG2.C2 = c(11, 13, Inf, 10),
  LOG2.T1 = c(Inf, Inf, 8, 11),
  LOG2.T2 = c(Inf, Inf, 7, 12)
)
# Prot1/2 are present in Control, absent in Treatment
# Prot3 is present in Treatment, absent in Control
# Prot4 is present in both

metadata <- data.frame(
  log2_col = c("LOG2.C1", "LOG2.C2", "LOG2.T1", "LOG2.T2"),
  group = c("Control", "Control", "Treatment", "Treatment")
)
# Note: T is [1] (second_group), C is [2] (first_group)
selected_cond <- c("Treatment", "Control")

unique_list <- obtain_unique_proteins(df_prot, metadata, selected_cond)

# cond1_unicas (Control) should have Prot1, Prot2
print("Unique to Control:")
print(unique_list[[1]]$Protein)

# cond2_unicas (Treatment) should have Prot3
print("Unique to Treatment:")
print(unique_list[[2]]$Protein)
