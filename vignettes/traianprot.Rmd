# 1. Introduction

**TraianProt** is an interactive R/Shiny package designed to simplify the downstream analysis of wide-format proteomics data.  
It provides a modular workflow for processing both **label-free** and **labeled** quantitative data obtained from **Data-Dependent Acquisition (DDA)** or **Data-Independent Acquisition (DIA)** mass spectrometry experiments.

Supported input formats include output from tools such as **MaxQuant**, **MSFragger**, **DIA-NN**, **ProteoScape**, and **Proteome Discoverer**.



## Key Features

- 🔹 Intuitive user interface built on **Shiny**  
- 🔹 Flexible data input compatible with common proteomics pipelines  
- 🔹 Integrated normalization and filtering procedures  
- 🔹 Robust differential analysis and visualization tools  
- 🔹 Functional enrichment and **PPI network** exploration  

> 💡 *This vignette provides a step-by-step walkthrough of the TraianProt workflow — from data import to biological interpretation.*



# 2. Data Preparation

Before starting, ensure your data file is formatted appropriately (e.g., protein groups table or peptide intensities).  
Each column should correspond to a **sample** or **condition**, and rows should represent **proteins or peptides**.

```{r}
# Example: Reading example dataset
example_data <- read.csv("example_proteins.csv", header = TRUE)
head(example_data)
```

> ⚠️ *Tip: Missing values can occur frequently in proteomics data — TraianProt offers integrated imputation tools to handle these gracefully.*



# 3. Using the Application

Launch the Shiny interface by running:

```{r}
library(traianprot)
traianprot()
```

Once launched, the main interface presents a **modular workflow**, allowing you to perform each analysis step sequentially.


# 4. Core Modules Overview

TraianProt provides a comprehensive suite of analytical modules:

### 4.1 Data Filtering
Filter proteins or peptides based on user-defined criteria such as detection frequency or intensity thresholds.

### 4.2 Normalization
Apply normalization procedures (e.g., log-transformation, median centering) to correct for technical bias across samples.

### 4.3 Missing Value Imputation
Automatically fill in missing values using common proteomics imputation methods.

### 4.4 Statistical Analysis
Perform robust statistical testing (e.g., t-tests, ANOVA, or linear models) to identify **differentially abundant proteins**.

### 4.5 Functional Enrichment Analysis
Integrate biological context using GO, KEGG, or Reactome enrichment methods.

### 4.6 Protein-Protein Interaction Networks
Visualize **PPI networks** to reveal functional relationships between identified proteins.

# 5. Visualization

TraianProt generates publication-quality visualizations such as:

- Volcano plots for differential abundance  
- PCA plots for sample clustering  
- Heatmaps for expression patterns  
- Barplots and dotplots for enrichment results  

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# Example: Visualization function call
plot_volcano(results_table)
```

> 📊 *All plots can be exported in high resolution for inclusion in reports or publications.*



# 6. Exporting Results

All processed data, statistical results, and plots can be easily exported for downstream reporting.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# Export results as CSV
write.csv(results_table, "Differential_Proteins.csv", row.names = FALSE)
```

> 💾 *Outputs include normalized intensity tables, differential analysis results, and enriched term summaries.*


# 7. Session Information

For reproducibility, include session information:

```{r}
sessionInfo()
```


# 8. Summary

**TraianProt** streamlines the analysis of proteomics datasets within an intuitive graphical interface.  
From normalization to enrichment analysis, it supports a complete and reproducible workflow.

> 🎯 *Whether you are a beginner or experienced researcher, TraianProt provides a fast and transparent way to extract biological insights from quantitative proteomics data.*
